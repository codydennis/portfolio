       <h2>Nice to meet you! I'm a product designer based in San Francisco.</h2>
       <p>Iâ€™ll admit like almost every kid, drawing was purely for fun at first. Summer days  with my brother creating the coolest rocketship with the best gizmos we could imagine. All the pencil shavings and crumpled paper across our living room floor in my attempt to outdo him when he challenged me (he let me win). In my early teens, it led me to my first experience with web design, when I taught myself front-end, and launched a portfolio! Drawing still dominated my life for the next decade, but from that point on I had the heart of a designer. </p>
       <p>One of the most memorable experiences I had in my mid-teens was using my skills to raise a few thousand dollars for the Tuberous Sclerosis Alliance. Getting to know people in the community, seeing how the design connected with their stories, and helped raise money for a cause I hold close, changed me. It stayed with me even as I left my hometown of Los Angeles in 2011 to attend California College of the Arts and major in illustration. I realized during my time there that my strongest work was influenced by design and the same elements of connecting with people to. One of those pieces on PTSD even got into the Society of Illustrators! As I graduated and got one of my first jobs in tech focused on machine learning I found other passions for psychology, tech, business, leading teams, and my discovery of product design.
