    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <h2>Improving patient adhearence and health</h2>
    <p>Complex prescription apps are contributing to the skyrocketing rate of patient non-adhearence.
     From unclear feedback to late deliveries, poor design in digital pharmacies has life threatening consequences.</p>
    <p>Over the years I’ve had my share of poor experiences that resulted in missing medication.
    Misses which impacted tests months down the road. In early 2018 I took this on as a personal project to explore solutions that could repair the broken pharmacy experience.  </p>

      <div class="problem">
      <h4>Problem</h4>
      <h2>Patient non-adherence</h2>
     <p>Over 50% of patients do not take their prescriptions and 30% fail to fill them at all. Resulting in 30%-50% of treatment failures, hospitalization, and 125,000 deaths per year. </p>
      </div>
    <div class="solution">
    <h4>Solution</h4>
    <h2>Pill reminders & simple pharmacy</h2>
    <p>Use of mobile pill reminders improves adherence by a minimum of 12.3%. Integration of an efficient and transparent
    pharmacy results in an additional increase in adherence. </p>

    <h2>7/10 Americans take prescriptions</h2>
    <p>Research gathered from my survey of 55 participants and supplemental studies show the average American takes at least one prescription, is non-adherent 1–4 times a month, prefers non-physical contact with pharmacists,
    and wants clear communication during the order process.</p>

<!-- Competitive Analysis -->

      <h4>Analysis</h4>
      <h2>Competitors and defining the target market</h2>
      <p>CVS Pharmacy, Walgreens, and Kaiser Permanente are positioned towards the growing
       senior population in the United States. However, recent findings suggest present-day
       solutions to mobile digital health does not improve the health of seniors. People more
       likely to use health apps are younger. Reducing Spheres target demographic to 25–45 allows
       for the adoption of the app in the short term while still positioning Sphere towards the
       growing senior population long term.</p>

  <p>I interviewed a group of participants from my survey to better understand their motivations,
  goals, and frustrations. The primary user personas for Sphere were Madelyn S. and Nate V. The
  final user persona is Sean, our free user. Sean only takes allergy medication and wants to set
  pill reminders. The free persona was used to evaluate features used without an account. Providing
   value to the user and building trust prior to gathering personal and private medical information.

<!--User Stories and Flows-->
<div class="user-stories">
  <h2>User Stories and flows</h2>
  <p>To properly simplify processes for patients I asked myself two important questions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>What was keeping people from using health products?</li>
    <li>For people who once used them, why did they stop?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  A study conducted by the NCBI discovered time to manually enter data, hidden costs, and apps being
  confusing to use as the top reasons for non-use or discontinuing use. Therefore, I created stories
  and flows with a goal of reducing processes down to the bare minimum. Adding on carefully and only
  when necessary.

<h4>High Fidelity Mockups</h4>
<h2>Mockups: A/B, critique, and user testing</h2>
<p>One of the challenges I faced was the massive amount of medical information. For that reason,
I dedicated most of my time to the information architecture above. I initiated that in the design
phase by starting with black and white designs and moving quickly to color which helped drive the
project forward.

<h2>A/B Testing: Today and Prescriptions</h2>
<p>I ran an A/B test on the Today and Prescriptions screens to assist in guiding the design of other
aspects of the app. Option B was chosen 80% of the time, however, I took note of strong aspects of
the white design along with issues I spotted to create a stronger more cohesive design. Some of the
highlights are below:

<section class="conclusion">
<div class="learn">
<h4>What I learned</h4>
<h2>Design decisions, consistency, and communication</h2>
<p>
Working on Sphere Pharmacy forced me to think about the impact of my design decisions. One of the
most valuable insights I had was to be ok with not getting it right the first time. By failing
earlier you can reduce how you impact users. Being willing to continously cycle back through with
users and stay truly interested in how your design breaks is crucial. They’re not only helping you
become a better more effective designer, but showing you what they need to lead healthier and happier lives.
</p>
<p>
I also learned a lot about maintaining consistency and communication throughout a product. Not only
does consistency ease user expectations through flows it builds trust and makes an app worth using.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, although this was a personal project I learned a lot about not working in a silo. I made it
point to reach out to my community of designers for critique and communicating with users in order
to drive the product. The team focused mindset is really what guiding me to stronger solutions.
