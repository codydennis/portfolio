    <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
    <p>CVS Pharmacy, Walgreens, and Kaiser Permanente market their apps to the growing senior population
      in the United States. However, recent findings suggest present-day solutions to mobile digital
      health <a href="https://www.mobihealthnews.com/content/senior-citizens-less-likely-use-digital-health-tools-jama-study-finds" target="_blank">does not improve the health of seniors</a>. According to research, a younger demographic is
      more likely to adopt health apps. Reducing Spheres target demographic to 25–45 allows for the
      adoption of the app in the short term while still positioning Sphere towards the growing senior
      population long term.</p>

  <h2>User personas </h2>
  <p>I interviewed a group of participants from my survey to understand their motivations, goals, and
    frustrations better. The primary user personas for Sphere were Madelyn S. and Nate V. The final
    user persona is Sean, our free user. Sean takes the occasional allergy pill and wants to set reminders.
     The free persona was used to evaluate the features used without an account. Helping to build trust
      before gathering personal and private medical information.</p>

  <h2>User stories and flows </h2>
  <p>To simplify processes for pharmacy patients, I asked myself two essential questions: What was keeping
    people from using health products? For people who once used them, why did they stop?
    A study conducted by the NCBI discovered time to manually enter data, hidden costs, and apps being
    confusing to use as the top reasons for non-use or discontinuing use. Therefore, I created user
    stories and flows with a goal of reducing processes down to the bare minimum. Adding on carefully
    and only when necessary.</p>

<h2>Sketching and low-fidelity</h2>
<p>Giving users the ability to experience pill reminders without an account would help build trust.
   However, if one of the most straightforward features didn’t work correctly, there would be no
   reason to onboard and use Sphere as their pharmacy.</p>

  <h2>High fidelity</h2>
  <p>One of the challenges I faced was the massive amount of medical information. For that reason, I
    dedicated most of my time to the information architecture above. I initiated that in the design
    phase by starting with black and white designs and moving quickly to color which helped drive
    the project forward.</p>

    white design along with other issues I spotted to create a stronger more cohesive design.</p>

    the feedback I received from the usability test I iterated on some of the screens below.</p>
  <p><span class="highlight">1. New medication</span> - Screen for information when adding new medications.</p>

    <h2>What I learned</h2>
    <p>Working on Sphere Pharmacy forced me to think about the impact of my design decisions.
      One of the most valuable insights I had was to be ok with not getting it right the first time.
       By failing earlier, you can reduce how you impact users. Being willing to continuously cycle
       back through with users and stay genuinely interested in how your design breaks are crucial.</p>
       <p>I also learned a lot about maintaining consistency and communication throughout a product.
         Not only does it ease user expectations it builds trust and makes an app worth using.</p>
          <p>Lastly, although this was a personal project I learned a lot about not working in a silo.
            I made it a point to reach out to my community of designers for critique and communicating
            with users to drive the product forward.</p>
