  <div class="mobile">
  <h2>Mobile</h2>
  <p>Designing for mobile and desktop at the same time was very challenging. Tests I was running on the
    desktop version of Fruition always made mobile inconsistent and fixing them required more time than
    I had available.</p>
    <p>To improve consistency and make better use of my time, I had to rethink my approach. While bringing
       mobile up to speed, each decision I made had to work at scale. Flows were restructured to look and
        behave the same, and if I hid any information on mobile, I made it obvious to find. Sticking to
        these principles resulted in very consistent outcomes in final usability tests and a more enjoyable
        experience for users.</p>

    <div class="learnings">
    <h2>What I learned</h2>
    <p>Since mobile-first is a relatively new approach, I learned so much about the challenges companies
       have trying to scale down their products. It's one thing trying to distill the product down to
       make it usable on mobile and an entirely different one being mobile-first while ensuring the
       product can accommodate a multi-device future. </p>
       <p>I also learned a lot about managing a broad scope. After interviews with users, it was so easy
         for the project to get out of hand by focusing on unnecessary features. By saying no and always
         coming back to core features that were defined through interviews, personas, and stories, I was
         able to zero in on the solution. </p>
          <p>Lastly, what I learned about managing scope taught me a lot about reaching "good enough"
             on a large project. With little time, it's so essential knowing where to focus your efforts
              and when to stop. Part of what helped me is leaning on user research and a team (design
              community) to work my way out of challenges. While Fruition has a long way to go, it's
              absolutely a solid jumping off point and always better than an unfinished "perfect" project.</p>
