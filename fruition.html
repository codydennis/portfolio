  <h2>User personas </h2>
  <p>I interviewed participants interviewed participants﻿ from Pennsylvania followed by states ranked 2-10,
    such as New Hampshire, Delaware, and Connecticut. In short, the majority of borrowers want a product
    focused on loan counseling and details of their student loans.</p>

  <div class="stories">
  <h2>User stories and flows </h2>
  <p>After developing user stories, I created seven user flows and a sitemap focused around the roadmap,
    counseling, and dashboard. The direction research took me meant the product would require a much
    larger team of counselors, writers, and finance professionals. I understood my job would be to
    create a reusable and straightforward design that made content easy to implement and consume.</p>

<h2>Sketching and low-fidelity</h2>
<p>Before sketching, I considered a mobile-first or desktop-first approach. Although mobile-first is my
  preferred method, the limitations it posed for core features would make most of the product unusable
  on mobile. For that reason and a short timeframe, I prioritized desktop for the MVP while working
  on mobile at the same time.</p>

<p>I facilitated usability testing on low-fidelity wireframes. At this point, the design lacked vital

  <div class="hifi-mockups">
  <h2>High fidelity</h2>
  <p>Moving into high-fidelity wireframes, I focused on the two most viewed pages of Fruition: the
    landing page and dashboard. I used the decisions and iterations made on these screens to guide
    the interface of the roadmap, messages, articles, and profile.</p>

  <div class="dashboard">
  <h2>Dashboard</h2>
  <p>Ascend was a temporary name I gave the product while running five tests on the dashboard. An initial
    A/B test on navigation showed a preference for the horizontal navigation bar shown below. Through
    this test and a design critique I found four main preferences and issues:</p>
  <p><span class="highlight">1. F-Pattern</span> - Users were more comfortable with option A and small cards on the left.</p>
  <p><span class="highlight">2. Buttons</span> - Easy to find, and I began to use its placement on every page with primary buttons.</p>
  <p><span class="highlight">3. Graph</span> - Graph was not informative and needed refinement.</p>
  <p><span class="highlight">4. Progress</span> - Meter was generic and the lack of information confused users.</p>

  <div class="iteration">
  <h2>Iteration</h2>
  <p>While working through iterations, I struggled to balance the navigation bar with active data.
     I ran three inconclusive colors tests. The fourth and final test below led to a more precise
     direction for the dashboard.</p>

  <div class="pref">
  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>Although Option A won the preference test, feedback from users and designers swayed my choice to
    Option C. The dark and neutral navigation bar anchored the page better than A or B and allowed the
    data to come forward. I also made the following changes to the dashboard based on user feedback.</p>
  <p><span class="highlight">1. Credit rating</span> - Users were more comfortable with option A and small cards on the left.</p>
  <p><span class="highlight">2. Line Graph</span> - Easy to find, and I began to use its placement on every page with primary buttons.</p>

    <p>While the dashboard was evolving, I ran an A/B test on the landing page wireframes.
      The results and written feedback showed a preference for specific aspects of Option A
      that B didn’t provide as effectively.</p>

  <div class="mobile">
  <h2>Mobile</h2>
  <p>Designing for mobile and desktop at the same time was very challenging. Tests I was running on the
    desktop version of Fruition always made mobile inconsistent and fixing them required more time than
    I had available.</p>
    <p>To improve consistency and make better use of my time, I had to rethink my approach. While bringing
       mobile up to speed, each decision I made had to work at scale. Flows were restructured to look and
        behave the same, and if I hid any information on mobile, I made it obvious to find. Sticking to
        these principles resulted in very consistent outcomes in final usability tests and a more enjoyable
        experience for users.</p>

  <div class="iterations">
  <h2>Additional iterations</h2>
  <p>With little time left, the goal was to make sure users could complete tasks with as little
    hiccups as possible and then launch, test, and iterate more accurately. These are some of
    the changes I made from the second round of usability tests.</p>

  <section class="section-1">
    <div class="learnings">
    <h2>What I learned</h2>
    <p>Since mobile-first is a relatively new approach, I learned so much about the challenges companies
       have trying to scale down their products. It's one thing trying to distill the product down to
       make it usable on mobile and an entirely different one being mobile-first while ensuring the
       product can accommodate a multi-device future. </p>
       <p>I also learned a lot about managing a broad scope. After interviews with users, it was so easy
         for the project to get out of hand by focusing on unnecessary features. By saying no and always
         coming back to core features that were defined through interviews, personas, and stories, I was
         able to zero in on the solution. </p>
          <p>Lastly, what I learned about managing scope taught me a lot about reaching "good enough"
             on a large project. With little time, it's so essential knowing where to focus your efforts
              and when to stop. Part of what helped me is leaning on user research and a team (design
              community) to work my way out of challenges. While Fruition has a long way to go, it's
              absolutely a solid jumping off point and always better than an unfinished "perfect" project.</p>
