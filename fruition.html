    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Complex prescription apps are contributing to epidemic levels of non-adherence. Sphere was designed with a goal of seeing a measurable increase in adherence and improvement of patient health.</p>

    <p>Over the years I’ve had my share of poor experiences that resulted in missing medication.
    Misses which impacted tests months down the road. In early 2018 I took this on as a personal project to explore solutions that could repair the broken pharmacy experience.</p>

    <h2>Demographic</h2>
    <p>According to data gathered by the Federal Reserve in 2016, adoption of
      financial apps is highest by a young educated demographic. I decided my
      approach would be to gain users by partnering primarily with colleges.
      To dig deeper into that approach I answered two questions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What state had the highest average and proportion of debt? </li>
        <li>What schools in that state were highest in those two categories?</li>
    </ul>
    <p> It turned out that Pennsylvania is ranked number one in both categories.
      The highest ranked colleges in Pennsylvania are Lincoln University,
      Penn State Hazleton, and Penn State Greater Allegheny.

    The majority of borrowers want a product focused on loan counseling and

<!--User Stories and Flows-->
<div class="user-stories">
<h2>User stories and flows</h2>
<p>I created seven user flows and a sitemap of the product that you can see in the
   link below. The main flows included onboarding, selecting a loan status,
   counselor chat, adding a student loan, and a roadmap with tools.
</p>
<p>
The direction research took me would ultimately require a much larger team of counselors, writers, and finance professionals to make the experience what it needs to be. I understood my job would be to create a reusable and simple design that
handled content well and could be swapped in and out easily.

<div class="sketching-intro">
<h2>Sketching and low-fidelity</h2>
<p>Prior to sketching I lead with content and thought about a mobile-first or
  desktop-first approach. The mobile-first approach is typically my preferred
  method, but the limitations it posed for core features and roadmap checkpoints
  in particular would render major parts of the product almost unusable on mobile.
</p>
<p>
I wasn’t convinced with a relatively short timeframe and as the only designer
that mobile-first was the right approach in this situation. I prioritized desktop
for the MVP while working on mobile at the same time. Replicating the desktop experience as much as possible.

<h2>Mobile Challenges</h2>
<p>Creating mobile designs at the same time as desktop and iterating was insanely difficult.
  It got out of hand quickly and often. I tried to manage it by keeping designs relatively close

<p>I finally brought the landing page and desktop up to speed, but the rest of mobile was grayscale,
  inconsistent, and frankly old designs. Luckily, the difficulties on mobile were eased by the thoroughness

<h2>Logo Design</h2>
<p>The branding for Fruition came later in the process of this project. I started sketching ideas
  related to students and the loan process, but struggled with its form. After some thorough
  analog and digital sketching I landed on a graduation cap made out of two F’s. Reusing the product
  typography for its wordmark. I put together a style guide detailing its proper use and other aspects
   of the Fruition system.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
I learned so much over the course of this project and especially about mobile-first design.
In my decision to design desktop-first I had the opportunity to understand where many companies stand today.
Faced with scaling down their products and tackling the difficult challenges that come with that.
It ultimately reaffirmed my preference for mobile-first, but the design process can be messy.
Limited by timeframe, resources, and more requires you to adapt efficiently and produce quality work
for users and the business.
</p>
<p>
I also learned a lot about managing scope. The path my research led me to made it so easy to overthink and
allow the project to get away from me. I kept coming back to saying no to uneccesary features and continued
figuring out the core of the product. This process made me realize qualities about myself as a designer.
 My ability to refine, problem solve, work through huge project dips, and utilize other designers and
 user testing to find my out of challenges.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, as a designer who is detail oriented, reaching a point of “good enough” was a huge area of growth
for me.  There’s always more that can be improved, but it’s key to understand when a product is good enough
and launch on-time and within budget.
